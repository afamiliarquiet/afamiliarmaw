# the Magnificent Fire-Breathing Sword-Swallowing Maw!

---
### Made for [ModFest: Carnival](https://modfest.net/carnival)!

## Mod Info

as the name implies, there's two big features centered around your maw here:
### 1. Fire-Breathing!
drink from the "Curious Vial" and gain a minute (stacking) of "Draconic Omen"! (don't worry about the name, omens aren't real)

hold something fiery in your hand (like a torch, a campfire, a blaze rod, etc.) and press your breathe key (default: b)!

behold, fire! makes for a wonderful party trick.

#### 1.1 Potions?
that's right! if you have potion effects, they'll be spread by your fire! and the fire also shows the particles :)

### 2. Sword-Swallowing!
ok this part isn't really an exclamation mark.

you just get to eat swords. they're food. well.. the blades are, at least. the rest of the sword will stay.

### ?. _Poof!_ Transformation!
wait. what?

turns out that "Draconic Omen" thing was actually real. if you stack beyond 30 minutes of omen... 
there's something out there that takes interest, and alters you just a little to be able to breathe fire
without the vials or fire sources. (also, the vials become a tasty snack? weird.)

if that's not something you want, it turns out sword swallowing actually has a use - 
what they say about iron and the extranatural happens to be true here.
if you swallow an iron sword, that draconic transformation is reversed, and you're back to how you were before.


## etc.

i probably wouldn't recommend using this mod directly outside of ModFest: Carnival,
but hey if you wanna copy the fire breathing or something, go for it!
i'm personally quite fond of it compared to the particle mess i was trying to work with, and it's kinda amusingly simple.

have fun! that's about it
