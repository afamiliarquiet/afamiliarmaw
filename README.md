### Made for [ModFest: Carnival](https://modfest.net/carnival)!

## Mod Info

as the name implies, there's two big features centered around your maw here:
### 1. Fire-Breathing!
drink from the "Curious Vial" and gain a minute (stacking) of "Draconic Omen"! (don't worry about the name, omens aren't real)

hold something fiery in your hand (like a torch, a campfire, a blaze rod, etc.) and breathe! (default: b)

behold, fire! makes for a wonderful party trick.

#### 1.1 Potions?
that's right! if you have potion effects, they'll be spread by your fire! and the fire also shows the particles :)

### 2. Sword-Swallowing!
ok this part isn't really an exclamation mark.
you just get to eat swords. they're food. 

well.. the blades are, at least. the hilt area is better left untouched.

(you will have to tilt your head back to fit it in your maw though)

### ?. _Poof!_ Transformation!
wait. what?

turns out that "Draconic Omen" thing was actually real. if you stack the draconic omen too much (half an hour or so?)... 
there's some kind of spirit out there that takes interest and alters you just a little, just to be able to breathe fire
without the vials or fire sources. (also, the vials become a tasty snack? weird.)

if that's not something you want, it turns out sword swallowing actually has a use - 
what they say about iron and the extranatural happens to be true here.
if you swallow an iron sword, that draconic transformation is reversed, and you're back to how you were before.

## etc.

i probably wouldn't recommend using this mod directly outside of ModFest: Carnival,
but hey if you wanna copy the fire breathing or something, go for it!
i'm personally quite fond of it compared to the particle mess i was trying to work with, and it's kinda amusingly simple.
still a bit messy though.

have fun! that's about it.

(oh and beware the Narrator)

### it rambles (readme blogging)

not too much to do in this mod, but my goal was to fluff around and find out how to make a mod,
and pretty much all of the first few days of work making this got erased as i figured out how to do things better soo..
would've definitely been a bad idea to go bigger. maybe. i don't think i'd be as happy with it, it wouldn't be
quite so finished and polished up and tidy(..ish), which would be a shame.

like the keybind packet! that was a neat polishing up trick. not very hard, but i was avoiding it.
and the trick i pulled by removing particles and just burning my logic entity.., ahh, what a treat.
so much functionality for free by having a burning ThrownEntity.

all the textures are pretty much just modified from other stuff in the game. does that mean they're consistent?
mm... it's questionable. certainly the expanding fire breathing stuff doesn't fit with minecraft's projectile breath attacks.
but that's ok because this is mine, not craft's!
